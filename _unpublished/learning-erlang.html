<p>In the last days, I'm thinking about my coding adventures. I've learned JavaScript and Ruby (and a lot of cool stuff of C++) in 2011. <i>Really</i> learned them. Bought books, made little (and not so little) programs and stuff.</p>

<p>It was incredibly fun.</p>

<p>Now I'm studying a bit of Ruby on Rails (for two projects with some friends) and thinking about what's next. There're LOTS (and I mean LOTS) of ruby gems to learn how to use - mainly, I want to read rake and rspec's APIs - but I feel like this isn't the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Lisp, Smalltalk, Haskell, Erlang and others. After reading about some not-so-famous programming languages a bit, I've decided to learn some of them during 2012. A "journey" to adquire knowledge, if you say. I really can't see one of my pet projects being rewritten in one of those in the near future, but who cares?</p>
