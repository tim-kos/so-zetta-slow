I'm an electrical engineer, and here in college I have to do some hardware design. For this, we use the VHDL programming language, one of the main _hardware description languages_ available.

It's a language used to describe a digital circuit unambiguously, enabling it to be produced in a factory. Why should I talk about it here? I can't predict the future, but if someday I work with hardware, this reflection might help me.

In my last assignments, I decided to search for open source compilers/simulators, so I could do my homework from my MacBook instead of using the Windows machines from the lab. I found two projects: GHDL and FreeHDL. The latter isn't *really* worth considering, because it's too simple for the moment. The former is a good chunk
