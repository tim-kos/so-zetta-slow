title: About me
---

You can call me Carlos Agarie (pronounced 'ah-ga-rii-eh'). In some online communities, I go by the name Onox.

I'm a control/software engineer specialized in artificial intelligence. That is, you can expect some articles about programming languages (mainly <span class='important'>Ruby</span>, but there's C, JavaScript, MATLAB...), data analysis and whatever technical subjects I'm interested at the moment.

Until august/2013, I'm living in Prescott, AZ. I'm an exchange student at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embry%E2%80%93Riddle_Aeronautical_University) thanks to Brazil's [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) program.

I also play pok√©mon.
