title: So Zetta Slow
---

Hey.

This blog is a by-product of boring college classes and my readings of [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Edition-Designers-ebook/dp/B00125MJYM/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1344048960&sr=8-1). It's made using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

Everything (except my posts and, possibly, images) is open source and can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/agarie/so-zetta-slow).
